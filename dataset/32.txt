multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx480h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a dining room with a long table set for a meal. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and has red and gold plates, silverware, and cutlery. There are wine glasses and a menu card on the table. A man and a woman are sitting at the table, and there are other people in the background. The room has a high ceiling with wooden beams and chandeliers hanging from it. The walls are decorated with red curtains, and the overall atmosphere is elegant and cozy."

Q="What type of furniture is made of the same material as the white ceiling?"

<End of Context>

Note that the caption mentions "The room has a high ceiling with wooden beams". The ceiling is probably made of wood. However, the caption didn't mention anything about "wood", and the caption does not contain further details about the wood. Moreover, the accurate judgement of material is hard for caption modules. I need to crop the ceiling and use VQA to confirm this. If LOC or VQA fails, I can judge the meterial as wood according to the caption. If two results are different, I will judge the true answer according to the soundness of each answer. After determining the meterial of the ceiling, I'm able to ask VQA about the furniture which is made of the same material as the ceiling.

The image shows a large room with a high ceiling and wooden beams. The walls are painted in a light beige color and there is a large window with red curtains on the left side of the image. On the right side, there are several potted plants and a wooden bench. Hanging from the ceiling are several light fixtures with white glass shades. The overall atmosphere of the room is cozy and inviting.

Thought(The caption of the cropped image mentions the wooden ceiling and the wooden bench. I think the answer is bench. However, it doesn't have a detailed description about the ceiling and the bench, so the information may still be wrong. I'll continue to check the material of the ceiling and the furniture made of that material. If anything fails or abnormal during the subsequent steps, I'll directly judge the answer as "bench".)
