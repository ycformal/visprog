multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx232h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a bedroom with a large window on the right side of the room. The window has white curtains that are open, allowing natural light to enter the space. On the left side, there is a green sofa with colorful throw pillows and a wooden coffee table in front of it. Above the sofa, there are two round mirrors hanging on the wall. In front of the sofa is a fireplace with a mantelpiece and a vase of flowers on top. The bed is covered with a blue comforter with white flowers on it. The floor is carpeted in a light beige color."

Q="On which side is the clean bed?"

<End of Context>

The caption tells us there is a bed. The question uses "on which side", so it is asking for a relative position of the bed. The bed may be the central or main object in the image. I need to locate it, and then judge its position. No need to judge whether the bed is clean if there is only one bed. I assume it is clean. I will only judge which bed is clean if multiple beds are detected, because such judgement relies on VQA, which might not be accurate on such subjective questions.

Step(Locate the bed.)
Thought(Use LOC to locate the bed. Store the result in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='bed'))
<result>
[[265, 116, 616, 231]]
</result>
Thought(There is only one bounding box in BOX0. I'm sure there is only one bed. It is in the region of (265,116) to (616,231), so I have detected it. Now it is known that there is only one bed. I don't need to judge which bed is clean. Proceed to the next step.)
Step(Judge the position of the bed.)
Thought(We can judge this according to the bounding box. Note that the right side of the bounding box is 616. Since the width of IMAGE is 640, I know the bed is very close to the right margin of the image.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
Thought(The answer is "right". Store it in ANSWER0 since no ANSWER is assigned.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The bed is on the right of the image.'))
