multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx480h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a living room with a Christmas tree in the center. The tree is decorated with colorful ornaments, lights, and a star on top. On the left side of the tree, there is a snowman with a top hat and scarf. Next to the snowman, there are two small figurines of a dog and a cat. The dog is wearing a red Santa hat and is sitting on the floor in front of the Christmas tree. The room has a window with white curtains and a painting hanging on the wall."

Q="What kind of furniture has the same color as the tree in front of the wall?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is a tree in the image. Also, I know the color of the tree (because it is the main object of the question, I need to make sure its color). I will use LOC to locate the tree, and then use CROP to get the image of the tree. After that, I will ask VQA about the color of the tree. To know the furniture, I can only ask VQA. For instance, if the tree is green, then I'll ask what furniture is green. I cannot use LOC to identify all pieces of furniture, because "furniture" is such a broad concept..

The image shows a living room with a Christmas tree in the center. The tree is decorated with gold and blue ornaments and a star on top. On the right side of the image, there is a white dog wearing a red Santa hat. The dog is looking directly at the camera with its tongue hanging out. In the background, there are several stuffed animals and a snowman figurine. The room appears to be decorated for the holiday season.
