multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx396h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a group of horses running on a rocky hillside. The hill is covered in shrubs and bushes, and the sky is blue with a few scattered clouds. The horses are of different sizes and colors, with some being brown and others being black. They are galloping across the hill, with their manes and tails flowing in the wind. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in sight. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene."

Q="Do you think the horse is walking?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there are a group of horses. I'm sure this information is accurate because the question Q already mentions "horse". However, the caption says they are running instead of walking. I need to ask VQA whether horses are running or walking. Since it is hard for LOC to detect a group of objects, let's directly ask VQA on the original image.

Step(Ask VQA whether those horses running or walking, let it make a choice between running and walking.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
