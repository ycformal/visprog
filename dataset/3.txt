multimodal input: IMAGE (427wx640h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a kitchen countertop with various kitchen items on it. On the left side of the countertop, there is a black chalkboard with the words "What happens next?" written on it in white chalk. Above the chalkboard, there are two framed pictures hanging on the wall. The wall is painted in a bright yellow color and there are a few kitchen utensils hanging on a hook on the right side. In the center of the image, there appears to be a white toaster, a potted plant, and a few jars and containers on the counter. The countertop is made of wood and has a white tile backsplash."

Q="Do you see canisters near the appliance below the chalkboard?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is indeed a chalkboard. The chalkboard is the central object for this question. I need to locate it first. After that, I need to crop the region below the chalkboard to see what is the appliance and whether there are canisters nearby.

The image shows a kitchen countertop with various kitchen items on it. On the left side of the countertop, there is a white toaster with the words "Happy New Year" written on it in black chalk. Next to the toaster, there are two white salt and pepper shakers, a black coffee maker, and a glass jar with a lid. In the center of the image, there appears to be a potted plant with green leaves and a wooden cutting board with a knife on it next to a window. There are also a few onions and a bowl of fruit on the counter. The countertop is made of wood and there are white tiles on the wall behind it.
</result>
Thought(The caption is very clear. I already know the appliance is a toaster, and there are shakers and a glass jar near by, both of them are canisters. The next two steps are no longer necessary. I'm going to delete them. Directly summarize and answer.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
Thought(The answer is "yes".)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='yes')).
