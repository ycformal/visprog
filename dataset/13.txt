multimodal input: IMAGE

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a skateboarder performing a trick at a skate park. The skatepark has a concrete ramp with graffiti on it, and there are trees in the background. The skater is wearing a black helmet, knee pads, and protective gear. He is in the middle of a turn, with his skateboard in the air and his body leaning forward as he navigates the ramp. The sky is blue and the weather appears to be sunny and clear."

Q="Is the person to the right of the other person staring or sleeping?"

<End of Context>

From the question, I guess there might be a lot of people. From the caption, I know there is a skateboarder in the foreground. I guess this is the person "to the right of the other person". However, this is not for sure because there is no information about the position. I will locate all person in the image, and see whether I can determine the right most one. After locating the person, I can crop the image and ask VQA to get the answer.

Thought(I have detected a lot of bounding boxes. The first one is the bounding box with the highest probability. Let me look into this first. The width is 322-178, and the height is 297-153. This is a bounding box of a normal size, so it is likely the person in the foreground. Now I want to see whether there are bounding boxes at the right side of it. Let's determine this by filtering bounding boxes whose left x coordinate is larger than 322. Here are all filtered bounding boxes: [587, 80, 593, 92], [397, 95, 441, 108], [338, 107, 344, 118], [577, 82, 582, 91], [322, 95, 444, 121], [594, 79, 600, 91], [588, 79, 602, 93], [360, 104, 365, 111], [336, 106, 341, 113], [397, 99, 402, 108], [410, 98, 416, 107], [558, 89, 565, 98], [601, 79, 608, 88], [429, 97, 435, 106], [357, 104, 362, 111]. Except for [322, 95, 444, 121], all other bounding boxes are too small. I can't believe any of them is the person this question asks. For [322, 95, 444, 121], I find it contains a lot of small bounding boxes, so it cannot be a single person. The only valid bounding box is the first one, [178, 153, 322, 297].)

Thought(I already analyzed. The right most person mentioned corresponds to the first bounding box. I can directly proceed to the next step.)
