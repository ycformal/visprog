multimodal input: IMAGE

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a black cat standing on its hind legs in a bathroom. The cat is facing towards the right side of the image and appears to be looking down at the floor. The bathroom has a white tiled wall and a white toilet in the background. There is a shower curtain hanging on the wall next to the toilet and a trash can on the left side. The floor is tiled in a light beige color."

Q="Are there any shower curtains to the right of the cat?"

<End of Context>

The central object is the cat. I need to find the cat and see whether there are shower curtains to the right of the cat. There are two comprehensions of "right": the right side of the image and the spatial right position relative to the cat. The first one is simpler, so I can try the first comprehension, crop the right part of the cat and use LOC to find if there is a curtain. Otherwise, I will locate the curtain and decide its spatial relative position to the cat. I already know that the cat is facing towards the right side so this might be easy.

Step(Locate the cat.)
Thought(I can directly use LOC to locate the cat. Store the bounding boxes in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object="cat"))

Step(Locate the cat.)
Thought(I can directly use LOC to locate the cat. Store the bounding boxes in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object="cat"))
<result>
[[210, 37, 370, 279]]
</result>
Thought(Perfect! There is only one detected object. I'm sure this is the cat. Now proceed to the next step.)
Step(Crop the right side of the cat.)
Thought(Directly use CROP_RIGHTOF to do this. Store the cropped image in IMAGE0. The index argument is 0, the default value, so I don't need to set it.)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP_RIGHTOF(image=IMAGE0,box=BOX0))
