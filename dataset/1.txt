multimodal input: IMAGE

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows two elderly people sitting on a wooden bench at a beach. They are facing the ocean and the sky is clear and blue. The person on the left is wearing a beige jacket and a cap, and the person in the middle is holding a pink umbrella with a floral pattern. The umbrella is open and the people are looking out towards the horizon. The beach is sandy and there is a railing in front of the bench. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene."

Q="Is there an umbrella in the picture that is not closed?"

<End of Context>

Umbrella is the central object for this problem. I need to first locate umbrellas. For each umbrella, I need to ask whether it is closed. If any of the umbrellas is not closed, then I can give a "yes" answer to this question.

The image shows a person holding a large pink umbrella on a sandy beach. The umbrella has a cartoon image of a girl on it and is open, with the handle pointing towards the ocean. The person is wearing a green hat and is standing in front of a railing. In the background, there are other people on the beach and the ocean can be seen in the distance. The sky is blue and the weather appears to be sunny and warm.
