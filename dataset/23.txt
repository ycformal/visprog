CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows two men standing next to a brown horse on a dirt path in a wooded area. The horse is tied up with a saddle and bridle, and there is a blue duffel bag on the ground next to it. The man on the left is wearing a black jacket, jeans, and a baseball cap, and is bending down to pet the horse. The other man is standing behind the horse, wearing a white shirt, blue jeans, a black baseball cap and a plaid shirt. There are several other bags and equipment scattered around the path, including a backpack and a camera. In the background, there are trees and bushes, and the sky is blue and clear."

Q="What type of animal are the trees in front of?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is a horse, which is probably the answer, but I'm not 100% sure. The question asks the type of the animal the trees in front of. I can understand it as: there are some trees, and there is an animal in front of the trees. I need to locate the tree and the animal, and judge whether the tree is in front of the animal. If it is, then I will ask figure out what the animal is. If there are many animals, then I will check them one by one.
