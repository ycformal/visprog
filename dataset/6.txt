multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a modern bathroom with a walk-in shower. The shower has a glass door and a tiled floor. The walls are covered in beige tiles and there is a large mirror above the sink. On the left side of the shower, there are two wooden cabinets with a white countertop and a wooden vanity with a sink and a mirror above it. The countertop has a few items on it, including a pink towel, a soap dispenser, and a few bottles of soap and lotion. There is also a brown towel hanging on a towel rack next to the shower. On top of the countertop, there is an open shelf with a few framed pictures hanging on the wall. The floor is covered with a beige area rug. The overall color scheme of the bathroom is neutral and modern."

Q="Are the books to the left or to the right of the wood cabinet?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there are probably two wooden cabinets (but may be one or three, because the caption may not be 100% accurate). It is hard to determine the orientation of the cabinet, so "left" and "right" indicates the position on the image instead of the spatial position. To determine the relative position, I need to locate two major objects, wood cabinet and the book. I will determine the relative position according to the bounding boxes.

Thought(There are two bounding boxes. x coordinates 1 to 65 includes 1 to 39, y coordinates 257 to 283 includes 263 to 273. There might be multiple books. For this question, I need to consider them as a whole, so use [1, 257, 65, 283] as the bounding box.)

</result>
Thought(Four bounding boxes are detected. However, [181, 152, 206, 187] is a very small one, only 206-181=25 pixels in x and 187-152=35 pixels in y. According to the caption, there is a mirror, so this bounding box must be the image in the mirror. 125>123, 206<274, so [125, 264, 206, 379] is included or heavily overlapped with [123, 253, 278, 381]. This might be a wrong detection or there are multiple cabinets in [123, 253, 278, 381]. No matter what, I must adopt the larger one [123, 253, 278, 381] as the bounding box. Now there remains two bounding boxes: [123, 253, 278, 381] and [0, 259, 138, 426]. 123>>0 and 123<138 a little (138-123=15, which is small), y coordinate span 253 to 381 heavily overlaps with 259 to 426. They probably two cabinets in a row. This result is consistent with the caption which says there are two wood cabinets. Merge them to be a larger bounding box [0,253,278,426]. I can now get the relative position of bounding boxes.)
Step(Judge their relative position according to bounding boxes.)
Thought(We need to get the vertical central line of two bounding boxes and compare them to get the relative position. Let's divide this into substeps.)
Substep(Get the vertical central line of the book's bounding box [1, 257, 65, 283].)

Substep(Get the vertical central line of the books' bounding box [1, 257, 65, 283].)
Thought(The x boundaries are 1 and 65. So the vertical central line is x=(65+1)/2. This addition is simple so I don't need to call EVAL. The answer is x=66/2=33. I can head to the next step.)
Substep(Get the vertical central line of the cabinets' bounding box [0,253,278,426].)
Thought(The x boundaries are 0 and 278. So the vertical central line is x=(0+278)/2. This addition is simple so I don't need to call EVAL. The answer is x=278/2=139. Now I can compare them and get the relative position.)
Substep(Get the relative position.)
Thought(33<<139, so the books are to the left of the cabinets. But note that I considered the two cabinets as a whole. Let's answer the question.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
Thought(I should tell the answer is "left". But also notice the user that I detected two cabinets and combined them as a whole. So the books may be to the center of one cabinet and to the right of the other one. Since I haven't got any answer, store the result in ANSWER0.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The books are to the left of the cabinet. However, I detected two cabinets and combined them as a whole. So in fact, the books may be to the center of one cabinet and to the right of the other one.)
