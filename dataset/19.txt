multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx480h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young woman sitting in front of a bathroom mirror. She is holding a makeup brush in her right hand and appears to be applying makeup. The mirror is on a white countertop and there are various makeup items such as a black mug, a bottle of lotion, and a few brushes scattered around it. The woman is wearing a black and white patterned top and has blonde hair tied up in a bun. In the reflection of the mirror, she is looking at her reflection and seems to be in the process of applying her makeup."

Q="Is the mirror in front of the woman made of glass?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is indeed a mirror, and it is in front of the woman. I need to locate the mirror and ask its material. Although the woman is also a central object, I don't need to locate it at first, because there is also a imaginary woman in the image. Just locate the mirror and see whether the question can be answered.

Thought(There are 8 bounding boxes in total. Their sizes (w x h) are 61x146, 68x183, 167x123, 98x95, 333x334, 58x110, 304x99, 103x265. Note that some of bounding boxes are inside a larger one. I guess this is because the mirror can reflect the light beam and the image causes a wrong detection. Therefore, I would first choose the largest bounding box, the 5th bounding box with size 333x334 as the true mirror. If anything abnormal happens, I will track back and try other bounding boxes.)
Step(Crop the mirror.)
Thought(Directly call CROP. Since I want crop on the 5th bounding box, the index argument should be set to 4. Store the cropped image in IMAGE0.)

The image shows a young woman sitting in front of a bathroom mirror. She is holding a makeup brush in her right hand and appears to be applying makeup. The mirror is on a white countertop and there are several makeup brushes and a red purse on the countertop next to it. There is also a black mug and a bottle of lotion on the sink. The woman has blonde hair tied up in a bun and is looking at her reflection in the mirror.
