multimodal input: IMAGE

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young boy running on a street with a colorful kite in the air. The boy is wearing a red t-shirt and blue shorts and appears to be in mid-stride, with his arms and legs stretched out in front of him. He is running towards the kite, which is flying high in the sky. The kite has a red, yellow, and blue design on it. The street is lined with trees and there is a white garage door on the right side of the image. There is a trash can and a green bag on the ground next to the garage door. The sky is blue and there are a few clouds in the background."

Q="Do you see any fences that are not made of brick?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I can't see any fence. I don't know whether there is indeed no fence, or just because the caption is not detailed. As fence is the main object for this question, I need to first locate the fence. If I get no result, then I should tell the user there is no fence. Otherwise, I need to crop the fense and ask whether it is made of brick.

Thought(I got two bounding boxes. However, the first bounding box is too narrow as its width is only 52-30=22 pixels. It should be a wrong detection or not the fence this question asks. The second one is large enough. I guess the true fence is the second one. Therefore, I only need to focus on the second bounding box.)
Step(If there is a fence, then check whether it is made of brick.)
Thought(I need to crop the image on the second bounding box and ask the question to VQA. Let's divide this into two substeps.)
Substep(Crop on the second bounding box.)

The image shows a young child, probably around 2-3 years old, standing on the side of a street. The child is wearing a red t-shirt and blue and white patterned pants. They are looking up at a colorful kite that is flying in the air. The kite has a red, yellow, and blue design on it. The street is lined with trees and there is a white garage door on the right side of the image. The sky is overcast and the ground is wet, suggesting that it has recently rained.
