multimodal input: IMAGE

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a herd of elephants walking through a dry grassy field. There are around 10 elephants in total, with a large number of them in the foreground and a few smaller ones in the background. The elephants are walking in a line, with some in the front and some behind them. The field is covered in tall, dry grass and there are trees and bushes scattered throughout. The sky is overcast and the overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene."

Q="Which direction is the gray elephant facing?"

<End of Context>

There is a herd of elephants so LOC may not detect them well. Therefore, the answer of this question is not confidential. We should first locate the gray elephant, and crop the bounding box with the highest probability (the 1st element in the list). Then we ask VQA whether the elephant is gray. If it is, then we ask its direction. Otherwise, start with the second bounding box and so on.
