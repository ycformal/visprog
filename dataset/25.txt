CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a young man riding a brown horse in an equestrian competition. The man is wearing a white polo shirt, beige pants, and a black helmet. He is holding onto the reins with both hands and appears to be in the middle of a jump. The horse is galloping over a colorful obstacle, which is made up of pink, yellow, and blue poles. The background shows a grassy field and trees."

Q="What is the person that looks young wearing?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is a person riding a horse. The caption says a young man is riding, so it is probably accurate. The man is wearing a white polo shirt and beige pants. It is almost sure because the caption uses "is wearing" and the description is detailed. For such a problem, the caption is more trustworthy than VQA because I will VQA has limitations on the sentence length of the answer. I think I can directly draw the conclusion from the caption.
