multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx426h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a man and a woman standing in front of a giraffe. The man is on the right side of the image and is looking up at the giraffe with a smile on his face. The giraffe is facing the man and appears to be sniffing the man's nose. In the background, there are trees and bushes, and a wooden fence can be seen on the left side. The sky is blue and the overall atmosphere is peaceful and serene."

Q="Is the old woman to the right or to the left of the man near the giraffe?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is a man and a woman. The man is near the giraffe. One thing I cannot make sure is the relative position of the woman to the man. I first assume "left" and "right" in the question to be the plane position, as this is easy to judge. Let's find the bounding boxes of the man and the woman and judge their relative position.

Step(Locate the man.)
Step(Locate the woman.)
Step(Judge the relative position of them.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)

<End of Plan>

Step(Locate the man.)
Thought(Directly use LOC to locate the man. Store the result in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='man'))
Step(Locate the woman.)
Step(Judge the relative position of them.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)

<End of Modified Plan>

Step(Locate the man.)
Thought(Directly use LOC to locate the man. Store the result in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='man'))
<result>
[[462, 187, 639, 425]]
</result>
Thought(There is only one bounding box. It must be a good detection. I can move to the next step.)
Step(Locate the woman.)
Thought(Now call LOC to locate the woman. Store the result in BOX1 since BOX0 is already assigned.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='woman'))
Step(Judge the relative position of them.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)

<End of Modified Plan>

Step(Locate the man.)
Thought(Directly use LOC to locate the man. Store the result in BOX0.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='man'))
<result>
[[462, 187, 639, 425]]
</result>
Thought(There is only one bounding box. It must be a good detection. I can move to the next step.)
Step(Locate the woman.)
Thought(Now call LOC to locate the woman. Store the result in BOX1 since BOX0 is already assigned.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='woman'))
<result>
[[376, 346, 485, 424]]
</result>
Thought(I want to judge whether BOX0 is on the left or right side of BOX1. So let's focus on the vertical boundaries. For BOX0, the boundaries are x=462 and x=639. For BOX1, the boundaries are x=376 and x=485. I need to get the symmetric lines and compare their relative position. Let's divide this into several substeps.)
Substep(Get the vertical symmetric line of BOX0.)
Thought(The vertical symmetric line is x=(x1+x2)/2. x1=462, x2=639. This computation is easy so I don't need to use EVAL. x1+x2=462+639=1101. So the line ix x=1101/2=550.5. I can handle BOX1 for the same way.)
Substep(Get the vertical symmetric line of BOX1.)
Thought(For BOX1, x1=376, x2=485. So x1+x2=376+485=861. The vertical symmetric line is x=861/2=430.5. I can proceed to the next step.)
Substep(Get their relative position.)
Thought(Since 430.5 < 550.5, and their difference is large, I can judge that the vertical symmetric line of BOX1 is to the left of vertical symmetric line of BOX0.)
Step(Judge the relative position of them.)
Thought(Judging from BOX0 and BOX1, I know that the woman is to the left of the man. It's not necessary to consider another understanding of "left" and "right" since I've got a clear result.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
Thought(The answer is "left". Directly call RESULT to show it to the user.)
Implement(ANSWRE0=RESULT(var='left'))
