CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a vase of white roses on a wooden table in a living room. The vase is made of clear glass and has a gold rim. The roses are in full bloom with green leaves and stems. In the background, there are two people standing in the living room, one of them is holding a cup of coffee and the other is looking at the roses. The room is decorated with a brick fireplace, a couch, and a bookshelf. The floor is covered with a red carpet."

Q="What is in front of the bricks?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there is a brick fireplace. One possible understanding of "in front of the bricks" is something is facing the fireplace, which is a typical spatial relation. However, it is difficult to get the orientation of bricks, because bricks do not have a face like human. But I'm still capable to locate the corresponding region because "in front of" means the target object is near the bricks. Therefore, I only need to crop the bricks. Since bricks are the main object in the problem, let's locate them first.
