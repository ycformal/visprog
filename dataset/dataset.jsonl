The deer is facing towards the right side of the image, with its head turned slightly to the left. Its body is covered in a light brown fur, and its eyes are dark and alert.

The image appears to be taken during the day, as the sun is shining through the grass and casting shadows on the ground.\n</result>\nThought(The caption says there is a deer again.

The grass around them is a golden yellow color and is swaying in the wind. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a grassy field with more tall grasses. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene.\n</result>\nThought(Also deer.

Otherwise, elaborate on the next step with substeps, use Implement() to call external modules like CROP if you think there's no need to decompose, or use Thought() to express your thinking according to results of Implement, if there is no Thought after the current Implementation result encompassed in <result></result>. If you find subsequent steps should be modified, modify them after the Thought() with your reason (you can propose your thinking and modify subsequent steps in one action). Stop when you have decomposed a step or used Implement() and wait for the answer.\n- Before expanding a step or calling an external module, use a Thought process to outline your current reasoning. Summarize your findings with a Thought process after each implementation.\n- You can only decompose ONE step into substeps.\n- Make sufficient consideration because external modules based on AI like VQA and LOC may not be accurate and some words in the question may be vague.
