Otherwise, elaborate on the next step with substeps, use Implement() to call external modules like CROP if you think there's no need to decompose, or use Thought() to express your thinking according to results of Implement, if there is no Thought after the current Implementation result encompassed in <result></result>. If you find subsequent steps should be modified, modify them after the Thought() with your reason (you can propose your thinking and modify subsequent steps in one action). Stop when you have decomposed a step or used Implement() and wait for the answer.\n- Before expanding a step or calling an external module, use a Thought process to outline your current reasoning. Summarize your findings with a Thought process after each implementation.\n- You can only decompose ONE step into substeps.\n- Make sufficient consideration because external modules based on AI like VQA and LOC may not be accurate and some words in the question may be vague.

On the left side of the image, there is a tall building with a sign that reads \"Main Street\" and on the right side, there are several other buildings with shops and restaurants. The sky is blue and the weather appears to be sunny and clear. In the center of the street, a man is crossing the street at a red traffic light.

I'm sure the caption here is accurate because it is easy to recognize a traffic light and the caption even tells the detail about the light. Morever, the caption doesn't mention any fire hydrant. Therefore, the answer obtained from the caption is confidential. I can directly give the result without intermediate steps like LOC or VQA.\n\n<End of Thought>\n\nStep(Directly answer the question.)\n\n<End of Plan>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\nStep(Directly answer the question.)\nThought(From the above analysis, I can directly call RESULT and return \"traffic light\".)\nImplement(ANSWER=RESULT(var='traffic light))\n\n<End of Modified Plan>"}]}
