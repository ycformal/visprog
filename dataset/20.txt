CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a group of six people sitting around a dining table in a small room. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and is set with plates, bowls, glasses, and food. There are six people in total, four men and three women, all of whom are smiling and appear to be enjoying their meal. The room has a rustic and cozy atmosphere, with a wooden bench on the left side and a bookshelf on the right side. The walls are painted white and there are various items hanging on the walls. The overall mood of the image is happy and relaxed."

Q="Is the man to the left of the bowl leaning on a couch?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there are indeed people and a bowl. I can locate the bowl and find the man left to the bowl. If so, I will crop this man and whether he is leaning on a couch.

The image shows three elderly people sitting at a dining table in a small room. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and has plates of food, glasses, and a bottle of beer on it. The man on the left is wearing a yellow shirt and is sitting on a wooden bench, while the man in the middle is sitting next to him. The woman on the right is sitting at the table with a glass of beer and is smiling at the camera. The room appears to be old and dilapidated, with peeling paint and peeling walls. There is a window in the background and a door on the far wall.
