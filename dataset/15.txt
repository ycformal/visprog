multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx346h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a mother and her young son playing baseball in a park. The mother is standing on a grassy field with trees in the background. She is holding a yellow baseball bat and is in the process of hitting the ball with it. The son is running towards the mother, who is wearing a yellow shirt and a helmet. The ball is in mid-air, and the mother is looking down at it with a focused expression on her face. The image appears to be taken from a low angle, looking up at the mother and son."

Q="Who is playing?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I clearly know that a mother is playing with her son. There's almost no possibility that the caption is wrong because it even records the movement of the mother and the son. I am confidential with the result. I think I can directly give the answer.
