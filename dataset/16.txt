multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx427h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a vast field of tall, golden grass with a few trees scattered throughout. In the background, there is a giraffe standing tall and proud. The sky is clear and blue, and the horizon is visible in the distance. On the right side of the image, there are three deer lying down in the grass, facing the camera. The deer appear to be resting or lying down, with their heads resting on the ground. The grass is a golden yellow color, and there are no other animals or people in the image."

Q="Are there both horses and deer in the picture?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I know there are indeed deers in the picture because the caption module accurately points out there are three deers. I need to check whether there are also horses. Note that I should answer "yes" only if both deer and horses are present.

Thought(This is indeed a deer. Do the same to the other two bounding boxes.)
Substep(Crop the second bounding box.)
Thought(call CROP like the former one. The index is 1. Store the cropped image in IMAGE1.)
Implement(IMAGE1=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=1))
<result>
<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=132x128 at 0x79D2F80826E0>
The image shows two deer standing in a field of tall, dry grass. The deer are facing the camera and appear to be looking directly at the camera. They are both brown in color and have large, pointed ears. The grass around them is a golden yellow color and is swaying in the wind. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a grassy field with more tall grasses. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene.
</result>
Thought(Also deer. Ask VQA to verify.)
Substep(Ask VQA on the cropped image.)
Thought(Store the result in ANSWER1.)
Implement(ANSWER1=VQA(image=IMAGE1,question='Is this a horse or a deer?'))
<result>
deer
</result>
Thought(The second one is also a deer. Although there's a high probability that the third one is a deer, I'm not 100% sure, as there might be three deers and one horse, and LOC may have detected two deers and one horse. Check whether the third bounding box is still a deer.)
Substep(Crop the third bounding box.)
Thought(Now the index becomes 2. Store the cropped image in IMAGE2.)
Implement(IMAGE2=CROP(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=2))
<result>
<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=182x104 at 0x79D3201A9C00>
The image shows two deer lying in a field of tall, golden grass. The deer are facing towards the left side of the image, with their heads turned towards the camera. They appear to be resting or lying down, with one lying down and the other lying down. The grass is a golden yellow color and is swaying in the wind. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a dry, savanna-like landscape with trees and shrubs. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the deer.
</result>
Thought(Also a deer. Ask VQA to verify.)
Substep(Ask VQA on the cropped image.)
Thought(Store the result in ANSWER2.)
Implement(ANSWER2=VQA(image=IMAGE2,question='Is this a horse or a deer?'))
<result>
deer
</result>
Thought(OK. This is also a deer. Let's summarize what I've found and give the answer.)
Step(Judge and answer.)
Thought(I've verified that there are no horses in the image. All the bounding boxes detected by LOC are deers. Now give the answer.)
Step(Summarize and answer.)
Thought(Since there is no horse, the answer should be "No". Store the result in ANSWER3.)
Implement(ANSWER3=RESULT(var='No. There are no horses. I only detected deers.'))
