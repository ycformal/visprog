multimodal input: IMAGE (500wx281h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a black cat standing on its hind legs in a bathroom. The cat is facing towards the right side of the image and appears to be looking down at the floor. The bathroom has a white tiled wall and a white toilet in the background. There is a shower curtain hanging on the wall next to the toilet and a trash can on the left side. The floor is tiled in a light beige color."

Q="Are there any shower curtains to the right of the cat?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the cat and shower curtains. I need to find if there is a shower curtain to the right of the cat. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a cat and a shower curtain. They are correct because the caption directly mentions them which are included in the question. Unknown or unsure: Whether the curtain is to the right side of the cat. Plan: I need to locate the cat first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object="cat"))
<result>
[[210, 37, 370, 279]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: Also locate the curtain.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object="curtain"))
<result>
[[205, 0, 284, 171]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: Judge whether the curtain is to the right of the cat. 205<210 and 284<370, so the curtain is to the left of the cat. I need to crop the right of the cat and see if there is a curtain. The index argument is set to 0 since I crop on BOX0[0].)
Implement(IMAGE0=CROP_RIGHTOF(image=IMAGE,box=BOX0,index=0))

The image shows a gray cat standing on its hind legs on a white tiled wall. The cat appears to be sleeping or resting, with its head resting on the edge of the wall and its body stretched out. The wall is made of white tiles and there is a wooden door visible on the right side of the image. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the cat.
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is no information saying there is a curtain. Plan: since LOC already fails on the original image, it will likely to fail on the cropped image. I will ask VQA first to see if VQA recognizes a curtain.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='Is there a curtain?'))
<result>
yes
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: VQA says there is a curtain. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks if there are any shower curtains to the right of the cat, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER1=RESULT(var='yes'))
