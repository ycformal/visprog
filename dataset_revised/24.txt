multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx425h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a desktop computer setup on a wooden desk. The computer monitor is turned on and the screen is blank. Next to the monitor, there is a white keyboard with a red sticker on it. On the desk, there are also a few other items such as a water bottle, a black coffee mug, and a black telephone. The desk appears to be cluttered and messy."

Q="Is the CD small?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the CD. I need to locate the CD and figure out its size. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is no information about CD. I need to locate the CD. Unknown or unsure: Where is the CD? Locate the CD first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='CD'))
<result>
[[384, 174, 456, 235]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No need to filter false detections. Plan: Judge whether the CD is small. It is a single object, so it's better to judge by bounding box. The size of the CD's bounding box is 72x61. The bounding box is small, and I need to get the size of another object as a reference to know if CD is indeed small. Let's locate the mug.)
Implement(BOX1=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='mug'))
<result>
[[483, 166, 565, 263]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No need to filter false detections. Plan: Get the size of the bounding box. The size of the bounding box is 82x97. The size of the mug's bounding box is 82x97, which is larger than the size of the CD's bounding box. I can make sure the CD is small. I can give the answer. The question is "Is the CD small?", and I know the CD is small. So the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='Yes, the CD is small.'))
