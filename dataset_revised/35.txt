multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx453h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image is a collage of two photographs. On the left side, there is a young couple posing for a photo in a tropical setting. The couple is dressed in formal attire, with the woman wearing a pink dress and the man wearing a gray suit. They are standing in front of a backdrop of palm trees and a blue sky.

On the right side of the image, there are two photographs of the same couple. The man is standing behind the woman, wearing a black tuxedo with a white shirt and a black bow tie. He has dark hair and is smiling at the camera. The woman is sitting on a wicker chair with a bouquet of flowers in her lap. She is wearing a white wedding dress with a long train and has blonde hair styled in an updo. Both photographs appear to be from the early 20th century."

Q="What piece of clothing isn't white?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: I know there is a woman wearing a white dress and a man in a gray suit and a black tuxedo. I believe "suit" is the correct answer because it's easy to identify suits, and it's unlikely to misclassify other types of clothing as suits. Tuxedo is also a type of suit, and the caption even specifies the detailed type of suit on the right side of the image. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is "suit". Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks what piece of clothing isn't white. I know the suits in both sides are all of dark color, so the answer is suit.)
