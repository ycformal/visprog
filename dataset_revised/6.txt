CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a modern bathroom with a walk-in shower. The shower has a glass door and a tiled floor. The walls are covered in beige tiles and there is a large mirror above the sink. On the left side of the shower, there are two wooden cabinets with a white countertop and a wooden vanity with a sink and a mirror above it. The countertop has a few items on it, including a pink towel, a soap dispenser, and a few bottles of soap and lotion. There is also a brown towel hanging on a towel rack next to the shower. On top of the countertop, there is an open shelf with a few framed pictures hanging on the wall. The floor is covered with a beige area rug. The overall color scheme of the bathroom is neutral and modern."

Q="Are the books to the left or to the right of the wood cabinet?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are the books and the cabinet. I need to locate them and figure out their relative position. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there are wooden cabinets. This is true because the caption directly mentions the wooden cabinets which are included in the question. Unknown or unsure: The position of books and their relative position to the cabinets. Plan: I need to locate the books first.)

[[1, 257, 65, 283], [1, 263, 39, 273]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are two bounding boxes, I need to judge the size and position of them to find if there are wrong detections. Judge the size: The size for two bounding boxes are 64x26 and 38x10. The second one has a height of 10 pixels and is too small. Judge the position: 1=1, 39<65, 263>257, 273<283, so the second bounding box is included in the first one. It is safe to only focus on the first bounding box. Plan: Get the position of cabinets.)

<result>
[[123, 253, 278, 381], [181, 152, 206, 187], [0, 259, 138, 426], [125, 264, 206, 379]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There are four bounding boxes, I need to judge the size and position of them to find if there are wrong detections. Judge the size: The size for four bounding boxes are 155x128, 25x35, 138x165 and 81x173 The second one has a width of 25 pixels and is too small. Judge the position: 123<125, 278>206, 253<264, 381>379, so the fourth one is included in the first one. Now only need to focus on the first one and the third one: 138-123=15, 138<<278, so they are almost not overlapping. These are two distinct bounding boxes. It is safe to only focus on the first and the second bounding box. Plan: Judge the relative position of the books and the cabinets. (1+65)/2=33, so the center of the books' bounding box is (33,*). For cabinets, I need to combine the two bounding boxes to a larger one: [0, 253, 278, 426]. (0+278)/2=139. Since 33<139, I know the books are to the left of the cabinets. I can give the answer. The question asks are the books to the left or to the right of the wood cabinet, and I know the books are to the left. So the answer is left.)
