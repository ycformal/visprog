multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx428h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a baseball game in progress. The batter is at home plate and is in the process of swinging his bat. He is wearing a white uniform with the number 27 on it and a red helmet. The catcher is crouched behind home plate, ready to catch the ball. The umpire is standing on the right side of the image, watching the play closely. The field is covered in dirt and there is a fence surrounding the home plate. The image appears to have been taken from a high angle, looking down on the batter and the catcher."

Q="Are there any helmets or rackets that are red?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main objects in the question are helmets and rackets. I need to find if there are red helmets or rackets. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a red helmet. This is true because the caption directly mentions it, and it is included in the question. Unknown or unsure: Nothing. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks whether there are helmets or rackets that are red, and I already know there is a red helmet, so the answer is yes.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='Yes, there is a red helmet.'))
