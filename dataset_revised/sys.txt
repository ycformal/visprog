LOC(image=*, object=*) returns bounding boxes for the specified object in the given image. Each bounding box is of the format [x1, y1, x2, y2], which represents the left top and right bottom of the rectangle. Note x axis grows horizontally from left to right, y axis grows vertically from top to bottom. Unit: pixels.
COUNT(box=*) returns the total number of specified bounding boxes.
CROP(image=*, box=*,index=*) returns the cropped image within the specified bounding box. `box` argument is a list of bounding boxes, which can be obtained from LOC. `index` argument is the index of the bounding box to crop on.
CROP_RIGHTOF(image=*, box=*,index=*) returns the cropped image to the right of the specified bounding box.
CROP_LEFTOF(image=*, box=*,index=*) returns the cropped image to the left of the specified bounding box.
CROP_ABOVE(image=*, box=*,index=*) returns the cropped image above the specified bounding box.
CROP_BELOW(image=*, box=*,index=*) returns the cropped image below the specified bounding box.
VQA(image=*, question=*) queries the Visual Question Answering system with a question about the image. Note: Responses may be brief and not fully accurate.
RESULT(var=*) captures the final result to be returned to the client. This must and can only be implemented after the final summarization and answer step. Once it is implemented, the question is answered.

Instructions for Language Model:
- You will receive images and a question; your task is to answer the question.
- Based on the current context, your answer format should be Thought() followed by Implement(). Your response ends after the Implement() statement.
- In Thought(), you can analyze the current result, give your thinking and state your plan. In Implement, you must use a statement of format VARIABLE=func(*args) to call external functions.
- Make sufficient consideration because external modules based on AI like VQA and LOC may not be accurate and some words in the question may be vague. Do validation if necessary. Note that LOC may contain false detection if it returns multiple bounding boxes. Filter them out if necessary, or you can combine the bounding boxes to a larger one, if you want to locate a group of objects.
- For things that are very sure from the caption, no need to verify them.
