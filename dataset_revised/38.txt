multimodal input: IMAGE (322wx500h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows the rear wheel of a bicycle leaning against a wall next to a window. The bicycle has a black frame and a brown tire with white spokes. The handlebars are black and the seat is black. The window is open and the view outside is of a street with buildings and trees. The wall is painted white and there is a metal pole on the left side of the image. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the bicycle."

Q="What is the name of the animal that is the same color as the container on the left of the image?"

<End of Context>

From the caption, I cannot know the container is of what color. I only know there is a container from the caption. Therefore, I need to locate the container, and crop the container to ask what is the color of the container. Then I know the name of the animal of which color is the same as the container. I think there is not an animal in the scene, because the scene is not related to the animal and the caption doesn't notice any animal. I guess I need to enumerate an animal based on my knowledge.

Thought(The LOC module cannot detect the container. This is because the word "container" is so broad and it does not have a fixed shape or appearance. However, I notice that the question mentions "on the left", so I can crop the left part of the image and directly ask VQA the color of the container. I'll modify the next step to crop the left side.)
Step(Crop the left side.)
Thought(I need a bounding box covering the left side. The image is 322wx500h, so the bounding box of the left half is [0, 0, 166, 500]. So I divide this into two steps. In the first step, I will assign [[0, 0, 166, 500]] to a new bounding box variable, BOX1, and in the second step, I'll crop the image.)

The image shows a close-up of a bicycle wheel leaning against a white wall. The wheel is black with white spokes and appears to be in good condition. On the left side of the image, there is a gray metal pole with a hook attached to it. The pole is casting a shadow on the wall, creating a contrast between the light and dark colors. The background is blurred, but it seems to be an indoor space with a window on the right side.
