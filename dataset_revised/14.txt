multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx232h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a bedroom with a large window on the right side of the room. The window has white curtains that are open, allowing natural light to enter the space. On the left side, there is a green sofa with colorful throw pillows and a wooden coffee table in front of it. Above the sofa, there are two round mirrors hanging on the wall. In front of the sofa is a fireplace with a mantelpiece and a vase of flowers on top. The bed is covered with a blue comforter with white flowers on it. The floor is carpeted in a light beige color."

Q="On which side is the clean bed?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the bed. I need to locate the bed and figure out which side it is. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a bed. This is true because the caption directly mentions the bed which is included in the question. Unknown or unsure: The position of the bed. Plan: I need to locate the bed first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='bed'))
<result>
[[265, 116, 616, 231]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: The position of the bed is (265,116,616,231). This forms a rectangle with the two points (265,116) and (616,231). I need to find the position of the center of the rectangle. The x coordinate of the center is (265+616)/2=440.5. I also need to find the x coordinate of the center of the image. The right side is 640. The left side has an x coordinate of 0, so the center is 340. 440.5>340, so the bed is on the right side. I can give the answer. The question asks on which side is the clean bed. I know there is only one bed, and it is on the right side of the image, so the answer is right.)
Implement(ANSWER0=RESULT(var='The bed is on the right of the image.'))
