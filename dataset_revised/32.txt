multimodal input: IMAGE (640wx480h)

CAPTION_IMAGE="The image shows a dining room with a long table set for a meal. The table is covered with a white tablecloth and has red and gold plates, silverware, and cutlery. There are wine glasses and a menu card on the table. A man and a woman are sitting at the table, and there are other people in the background. The room has a high ceiling with wooden beams and chandeliers hanging from it. The walls are decorated with red curtains, and the overall atmosphere is elegant and cozy."

Q="What type of furniture is made of the same material as the white ceiling?"

<End of Context>

Thought(Analyze the question: The main object in the question is the white ceiling. I need to locate it and find the material. Analyze the caption: From the caption, there is a detailed description of the ceiling. The ceiling corresponds to the question. Unknown or unsure: The material of the ceiling. Plan: I need to locate the ceiling first.)
Implement(BOX0=LOC(image=IMAGE,object='ceiling'))
<result>
[[0, 0, 518, 115]]
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: There is only one bounding box. No steps need to be taken to filter false detections. Plan: Crop the image on the bounding box. The index argument is set to 0 since I crop on BOX0[0].)

Thought(Analyze the result: There is a ceiling. I've cropped the right region. However, the caption doesn't mention the material of the ceiling Plan: Ask VQA about the material of the ceiling.)
Implement(ANSWER0=VQA(image=IMAGE0,question='What the ceiling is made of?'))
<result>
wood
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The ceiling is made of wood. I need to find the furniture made of wood. Plan: Ask VQA about the wooden furniture.)
Implement(ANSWER1=VQA(image=IMAGE,question='What furniture is made of wood?'))
<result>
chairs
</result>
Thought(Analyze the result: The chairs are made of wood. Plan: I can give the answer. The question asks about the type of furniture made of the same material as the white ceiling. I know the ceiling is made of wood, and the chairs are also made of wood. So the answer is the chairs.)
Implement(ANSWER2=RESULT(var='The chairs are made of the same material as the white ceiling.'))
